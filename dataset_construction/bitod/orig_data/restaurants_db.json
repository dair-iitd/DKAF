The shop's intimate size, burnished red walls, dark wood furniture and simple details create warmth, while our cuisine creates fire. Based on the Ma La Tang concept for numbing (ma), burning (la) and neutral (tang) tastes of Sichuan food, our menu represents the breathtaking range of culinary possibilities fashioned by our chef each day, all using the freshest ingredients. Many people describe our food as orgasmic. The intensity mounts and grows until you reach the top. Then you have to calm yourself, and we have dishes for that, too. Our Sichuan specialties are for the daring palate. Dramatic and challenging, they offer an unforgettable experience. But there is also plenty on the menu for a relaxing dining experience with entrees that offer delicate flavor combinations. In 2015, we opened our second Soho location on Old Bailey Street in a more spacious venue where patrons can bask in the eclectic mix of contemporary and traditional Chinese d\u00e9cor, while enjoying the same fiery and complex flavors that our entrees are renowned for.",

From our communal tables, to our pick-and-choose antipasti platters, pastas and pizzas, everything at Ciao Chow fosters a convivial atmosphere where food is shared among family and friends. With a decidedly Italian touch, Ciao Chow\u2019s interior features monolithic marble counter tops and terrazzo floors blended with an industrial feel of exposed concrete, copper piping and light fixtures. Within our large seating area, our chef\u2019s table can fit up to 10 people to accommodate special requests and occasions. Our customers can be assured that all of the ingredients we use are of the highest quality and our cooking methods authentic. We do not cut costs for cheaper ingredients - period. Who would have thought that basic food ingredients could be so highly complicated? WE DO.",

    "description": "Beef & Liberty is our modern homage to the original beefsteak clubs and, we hope, the tastiest hamburger you will have tried in a while. We are obsessed with hamburgers. We have spent many years trying to create the perfect burger - one that is juicy, beefy, smoky and downright delicious. We think we have succeeded in our quest for perfection we are delighted to share our obsession with you. We proudly serve hormone-free grass-fed beef. Our beef is from Hereford cattle which are naturally raised by small-scale farmers in the Cape Grim region of Tasmania, which has the cleanest air in the world. Why grass fed beef? Cows naturally eat grass, which produces leaner meat, high in Omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin E. We freshly grind the beef in our burgers in-house daily and serve it on a custom-baked white sour-dough roll. Add friends and family, top it off with some great craft beers, house cocktails or a fresh Liberty lemonade and you've got our version of what a perfect hamburger experience should be. Recognized as \u201cthe best burger in Hong Kong\u201d by the South China Morning Post and awarded a Bib Gourmand by Michelin. Welcome to Beef & Liberty, we hope you enjoy it.",

A number of old-style condiment stores continue to adopt traditional ways to produce superb first extract soy sauce in its purest and freshest form, and hand craft beancurd sheets with strong bean taste. A small number of local fishermen are persistently sailing out during the early hours to the South China Sea to catch live fishes and shrimps.

At The Chairman, we have all along tried our best to acquire these freshest among the freshest ingredients, although their prices are slightly higher.",

    "description": "Crystal Jade takes pride in its famous Lanzhou-style \u201cLa Mian\u201d (hand-pulled noodles), which are made in house the moment customers place their orders. Each bowl of noodles is served in a wholesome, savory soup brewed from chicken, dry-cured ham and pork bone. \u201cXiao long bao\u201d (soup dumplings in Shanghai style) is another favorite signature dish, being exquisitely made with fresh meat and filled with flavorful juices. In addition to preparing classic home-style dishes like Saut\u00e9ed Prawn in Chilli Sauce, Beef Slices in Spicy Soup, and Braised Pork with Dried Beancurd Sheet, Crystal Jade also creates unique delicacies such as Sweet & Sour Cucumber Skin Roll, Chilled Black Fungus tossed in Aged Vinegar, and Sweetened Ham served with Crispy Beancurd Sheet and Chinese Bun to leave customers with a truly memorable gastronomic experience.",

The restaurant is committed to quality and is very particular about food ingredients, wines and coffee beans choices.",

All our meat is imported from family-owned farms where livestock is bred and raised in the pure wilderness. Cattle roam free and graze only on the nutrient-dense grasses, untainted by antibiotics, growth hormones, pesticides or pollutants. The result is a healthy beef with distinctive taste and with all the health and flavour benefits that come from being grass-fed animals. Quarter Master's philosophy is simply a matter of thinking beyond each ingredient and considering the environment from which it came. As well as inspiring a greater sense of social consciousness, the food we provide can extend the scope of creative possibilities in the kitchen \u2013 and ultimately enhance the quality of life.",

Not to miss out any details of how the British have their fish & chips, we have mushy peas and malt vinegar! Knowing different people have different preferences, we offer a variety of fishes, which our customers can choose from. To fulfill the local's preference, we have daily fresh Seabass and Barramundi while the foreigners can have their Cod or Haddock and many others. For those who are health-conscious, they may opt for the pan-fried fresh fishes. We all know that some people may not fancy fish & chips because of many other reasons, but fret not, we have French-style rotisserie chicken which we use fresh chicken from the local market and marinate it with our own special marinade before slow-roasting it. The end result will be a flavourful, tender, juicy chicken meat with a crispy skin. Some of the best reasons to come over to our restaurant is the atmosphere, seaview, excellent food, gentle sea breeze and the occasional splashing of waves. Customers coming with their cameras will want to sit at our semi-outdoor bench to take pictures and enjoy one of the best sunset in Hong Kong! We are a friendly and casual restaurant, therefore, you can relax with your glass of wine or your pint of beer while you have your meal. All our food in the menu are made and prepared with passion and love - from our fish & chips, roasted chicken, hand-prepared snacks & salad and home-made desserts, not forgetting, even our tartar sauce is unique because it is made by us, Fish & Chick!",

Inevitably, it will become your favorite restaurant for surprise romantic gestures, intimate dinners or organizing wine gatherings with friends, business dinners, wine events and private parties.WHISK transitions from the restaurant through to Vibes, the exclusive open-air lounge bar, that also serves as al fresco dining alternative for WHISK\u2019s famous Sunday Brunch with live DJ.",

The menu for Plat du Jour, meaning 'dish of the day', was created by long-term Swire Hotels collaborator David Laris who made its ever-changing daily specials the bistro's pre-eminent feature. Laris, who is renowned for his success at Sir Terence Conran's Mezzo and his namesake restaurant Laris at Three on the Bund, also ensured Plat du Jour would make waves with its all-time classics such as steak tartare, boeuf bourguignon, moule marini\u00e8res and tarte tatin. With burgundy leather banquettes, marble table tops, full length mirrors and a traditional mosaic entrance floor, Plat du Jour's interior, designed by Zangellini & Holt Associates, allows our guests to experience the cosy, much-adored Parisian bistro atmosphere.",
